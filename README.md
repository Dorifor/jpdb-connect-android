# Jpdb Connect Android
Android tool to mine selected words to jpdb.io (Text selection or Anki format sharing)

## 🤨 Lore
Lately I've been using my phone / tablet a lot for immersion, using the wonderful [Kanj Study](https://mindtwisted.com/) as my dictionary. I found it a bit of a shame that I couldn't really mine directly from it. So I made an "app" for that.

> I spent 8 hours to do this simple thing help

> I don't know how to make apps

⏩ Flash forward to the next day and I found out it was actually super simple to also just do that from any text selection, so let's go

## 🐉 Installation

1. Get the .apk file from [the latest release](https://github.com/Dorifor/jpdb-connect-android/releases/latest)
2. Install it (You may have to turn on permissions to "install from unknown sources" since it's not from the Play Store)
3. Profit

## 🐤 How to use


1. Get your API Key from [the JPDB Settings page](https://jpdb.io/settings)
2. Input it in the app (first input)
3. Select your target deck for mining (It has to be created by you)
4. Select any text by long pressing (**If you select multiple words, all of them will be added**)
   1. Tap "Add to JPDB"  
OR  
5. Select any word in Kanji Study (or any app that exports words to Anki / shares it) 
   1. "Share example" then select Jpdb Connect Android  
      OR
   2. "Add to Anki" (if you don't have it installed) then select Jpdb Connect Android
   3. When prompted select "always" to make it faster
  
> 👨‍💻 You don't have to start the app to use it every time, just for the initial setup
